  expirienceContent: '<p>My experience as a <b>frontend developer<\/b> encompasses a range of achievements in <b>web development<\/b> and <b>team management<\/b>. I started my career as a <b>freelancer<\/b>, working on various projects and receiving positive feedback from clients. This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge in <b>frontend development<\/b> and gain practical skills in real-world conditions.<\/p><p>Following this, I joined <b>Ultimatech<\/b> as a <b>Frontend Developer<\/b>, where I was responsible for <b>project support and development<\/b>, <b>performance optimization<\/b>, <b>bug fixing<\/b>, and <b>debugging<\/b>. I actively collaborated with <b>UX/UI<\/b> designers to enhance <b>user experience<\/b> and participated in <b>code reviews<\/b> to ensure high-quality products.<\/p><p>Over time, my role expanded, and I moved into the position of <b>Frontend Deputy Team Lead<\/b>. In this role, I tackled complex <b>technical tasks<\/b>, provided <b>mentorship<\/b> to team members, supported <b>code maintenance<\/b> and <b>optimization<\/b>. I also coordinated with other departments for seamless <b>integration of frontend components<\/b>, developed and implemented <b>coding standards<\/b>, modernized the <b>tech stack<\/b>, and regularly assessed <b>team performance<\/b>.<\/p><p>In September 2022, I was promoted to <b>Frontend Team Lead<\/b>.
